# merge sort

## homework
1. Merging with smaller auxiliary array. Suppose that the subarray 𝚊[𝟶] to 𝚊[𝚗−𝟷] is sorted and the subarray 𝚊[𝚗] to 𝚊[𝟸∗𝚗−𝟷] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that 𝚊[𝟶] to 𝚊[𝟸∗𝚗−𝟷] is sorted using an auxiliary array of length n (instead of 2n)?

2. Counting inversions. An inversion in an array a[] is a pair of entries a[i] and a[j] such that i<j but a[i]>a[j]. Given an array, design a linearithmic algorithm to count the number of inversions.

3. Shuffling a linked list. Given a singly-linked list containing n items, rearrange the items uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to nlogn in the worst case.
