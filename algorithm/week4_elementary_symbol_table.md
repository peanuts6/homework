## homework
1. Java autoboxing and equals(). Consider two 𝚍𝚘𝚞𝚋𝚕𝚎 values 𝚊 and 𝚋 and their corresponding <tt>Double</tt> values 𝚡 and 𝚢.

Find values such that (𝚊==𝚋) is 𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚎 but 𝚡.𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚊𝚕𝚜(𝚢) is 𝚏𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎.
Find values such that (𝚊==𝚋) is 𝚏𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚎 but 𝚡.𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚊𝚕𝚜(𝚢) is 𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚎.

2. Check if a binary tree is a BST. Given a binary tree where each 𝙽𝚘𝚍𝚎 contains a key, determine whether it is a binary search tree. Use extra space proportional to the height of the tree.

3. Inorder traversal with constant extra space. Design an algorithm to perform an inorder traversal of a binary search tree using only a constant amount of extra space.

4. Web tracking. Suppose that you are tracking n web sites and m users and you want to support the following API:

User visits a website.
How many times has a given user visited a given site?
What data structure or data structures would you use?
